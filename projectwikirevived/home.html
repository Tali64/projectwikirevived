					<p>On September 1, 2021, Google discontinued the legacy version of its site-building tool Google Sites (known as Classic Sites), restricting site creation to the new version of Google Sites (known as New Sites). Unfortunately, this meant the death of Project Wiki, one of the many templates of Classic Sites that was not included in New Sites; although the template itself was still available for viewing after Classic Sites was deprecated, as of August 31, 2023, this is no longer the case (fortunately, an archive exists <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221014004047/https://sites.google.com/site/projectwikitemplate_en/">here</a>).</p>
					<p>Project Wiki Revived aims to bring back the Project Wiki template with a modern look and feel, while still remaining faithful to the original. If you're nostalgic about Classic Sites and want the old templates back, this project is for you!</p>
					<p>Setting up Project Wiki Revived is simple: download the source code at <a href="https://github.com/Tali64/projectwikirevived">the GitHub repository where it lives</a>, update your site to use its page format, and you're done!</p>
					<p>Here is a table comparing Project Wiki with Project Wiki Revived:</p>
